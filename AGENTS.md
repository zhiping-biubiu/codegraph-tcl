# AGENTS.md

Canonical project guidance for coding agents working in this repository (Codex/Astra, Claude Code via `@AGENTS.md`, Cursor, etc.).

**Codex size note:** root `AGENTS.md` is intentionally kept near ~35 KiB (critical build/test/arch/retrieval rules retained). Longer validation methodology + the Excalidraw worked example live in `docs/AGENTS.md`. This environment sets `project_doc_max_bytes = 49152` so root (and root+`docs/` when cwd is under `docs/`) are not silently truncated at the 32 KiB default.

## Project Overview

CodeGraph is a local-first code intelligence library + CLI + MCP server. It parses any supported codebase with tree-sitter, stores symbols/edges/files in SQLite (FTS5), and exposes a knowledge graph to AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, opencode) over MCP. Per-project data lives in `.codegraph/`. Extraction is deterministic — derived from AST, not LLM-summarized.

Distributed as `@colbymchenry/codegraph` on npm; same binary serves as installer, indexer, and MCP server.

## Build, Test, Run

```bash
npm run build           # tsc + copy schema.sql and *.wasm + build the viewer into dist/; chmods dist/bin/codegraph.js
npm run build:lib       # the viewer's components as @colbymchenry/codegraph-ui (ui/dist) — NOT part of `build`
npm run dev             # tsc --watch
npm run clean           # rm -rf dist

npm test                # vitest run (all)
npm run test:watch
npm run test:eval       # only __tests__/evaluation/
npm run eval            # build then run __tests__/evaluation/runner.ts via tsx

npm run cli             # build then run the local dist binary

# Single test file / pattern
npx vitest run __tests__/installer-targets.test.ts
npx vitest run __tests__/extraction.test.ts -t "TypeScript"
```

`copy-assets` (called from `build`) copies `src/db/schema.sql` and all `src/extraction/wasm/*.wasm` files into `dist/`. **Any new SQL or grammar wasm must be copied or it won't ship.**

One other build step writes into `dist/` and is subject to the same rule: `build:ui` builds the
browser viewer into `dist/viewer/` (never `dist/ui/` — that's the terminal ui).
`scripts/check-ui-build.mjs` asserts both `dist/viewer/` and the copied grammars in
`dist/extraction/wasm/` after every build and inside every release archive — the viewer's syntax
highlighting reads a file with the same grammar the engine indexed it with, so a missing wasm is an
unhighlighted screen as well as an extraction gap.

`npm run build:lib` is separate and does NOT run as part of `npm run build`: it compiles the same
`ui/src` tree a second way, with `svelte-package`, into `ui/dist` — the `@colbymchenry/codegraph-ui`
component library the Pro app imports (task CG-61). `scripts/check-ui-package.mjs` then prunes the
standalone app's shell out of it, resolves the extensionless import specifiers `svelte-package`
leaves behind, and asserts the seam: nothing outside `lib/adapter.js` may reach the network. The
package is **prepared, not published** — `ui/package.json` carries `"private": true` deliberately,
and `scripts/pack-npm.sh` only packs a tarball when `CODEGRAPH_PACK_UI=1`.

Tests run as **two vitest projects** (`vitest.workspace.mts`): `engine` (node) and `ui` (jsdom, the
Svelte plugin, `resolve.conditions: ['browser']`) for the single `__tests__/ui-package.test.ts`.
`npm test` still runs both. The split is not cosmetic — `browser` is a package-resolution
condition, and applied globally it hands the engine's suites the browser builds of
`web-tree-sitter` and friends. The root config (`vitest.config.mts`, `.mts` because the plugin is
ESM-only and the repo is CJS) is the shared base; note that a workspace project **concatenates**
the base's `include` with its own, which is why the `ui` project does not `extends` it.

Node engines: `>=20.0.0 <25.0.0`. There is a hard exit on Node 25.x and below 20 (see `src/bin/node-version-check.ts`).

## Architecture

### Layered pipeline

```
files → ExtractionOrchestrator (tree-sitter) → DB (nodes/edges/files)
              ↓
       ReferenceResolver (imports, name-matching, framework patterns)
              ↓
       GraphQueryManager / GraphTraverser (callers, callees, impact)
              ↓
       ContextBuilder (markdown/JSON for AI consumption)
```

The public API surface is `src/index.ts` — the `CodeGraph` class wires all the layers and re-exports types. Library users only touch this file; the MCP server and CLI also drive it.

### Module layout

- `src/index.ts` — `CodeGraph` class: `init`/`open`/`close`, `indexAll`, `sync`, `searchNodes`, `getCallers`/`getCallees`, `getImpactRadius`, `buildContext`, `watch`/`unwatch`.
- `src/db/` — `DatabaseConnection`, `QueryBuilder` (prepared statements), `schema.sql`, `sqlite-adapter.ts`. Backed by Node's built-in **`node:sqlite`** (`DatabaseSync`) — real SQLite with WAL + FTS5, exposed through a thin better-sqlite3-shaped adapter. The bundled runtime always ships Node ≥22.5, so `node:sqlite` is always available: **no native build step and no wasm fallback**. (Running from source needs Node ≥22.5.) `codegraph status` reports the live backend (`node-sqlite`, the sole backend).
- `src/extraction/` — `ExtractionOrchestrator`, tree-sitter wrappers, per-language extractors under `languages/` (one file per language), plus standalone extractors for non-tree-sitter formats (`svelte-extractor.ts`, `vue-extractor.ts`, `liquid-extractor.ts`, `dfm-extractor.ts` for Delphi). `parse-worker.ts` runs heavy parsing off the main thread.
- `src/resolution/` — `ReferenceResolver` orchestrates `import-resolver.ts` (with `path-aliases.ts` for tsconfig path aliases + cargo workspace member globs), `name-matcher.ts`, and `frameworks/` (Express, Laravel, Rails, FastAPI, Django, Flask, Spring, Gin, Axum, ASP.NET, Vapor, React Router, Next.js — `nextjs.ts`: pages and `route.ts` handlers from files, `router.push` / `redirect` / `NextResponse.redirect` as `navigates` edges, with `next-router-synthesizer.ts` for `<Link href>` — Expo Router, SvelteKit, Vue/Nuxt, Cargo workspaces). Frameworks emit `route` nodes and `references` edges. `callback-synthesizer.ts` holds the whole-graph synthesis passes (`SYNTH_PASSES`, merged in registry order — first-seen wins a duplicate pair) with the language gates; `tier-synthesizer.ts` is the cross-tier pass (a client's literal `fetch`/`axios` path onto its own route, a queue job onto its consumer, a bus / socket event onto its handler — `channel`, `tier`, `registeredAt` on every edge; registered before the in-process emitter pass so its more specific edge wins); `synth-utils.ts` has the helpers they share (`enclosingFn`, `enclosingValue`, `makeLineAt`). Express's `postExtract` composes `app.use('/prefix', router)` mounts onto a mounted file's route names, idempotently (the original path stays in `qualifiedName`).
- `src/graph/` — `GraphTraverser` (BFS/DFS, impact radius, path finding) and `GraphQueryManager` (high-level queries), plus the shared query-time derivations more than one surface renders: `named-symbol-flow.ts` (the one path finder, behind `codegraph_explore`'s Flow section and the viewer's Flow strip), `dynamic-boundary-report.ts` (where the graph stops), `type-hierarchy.ts` (ancestors/subtypes and the implementation count explore prints and the viewer draws),
  `dead-code.ts` (unreferenced symbols, and every reason a candidate is NOT claimed). A derivation that two callers render must live here, not in `ToolHandler` — two derivations eventually disagree.
- `src/context/` — `ContextBuilder` + formatter for markdown/JSON output.
- `src/search/` — full-text query parser and helpers for FTS5.
- `src/sync/` — `FileWatcher` (native FSEvents/inotify/RDCW) with debounce + filter, and git-hook helpers.
- `src/mcp/` — MCP server (`MCPServer`, `tools.ts`, `transport.ts`). `server-instructions.ts` is what the server returns in the MCP `initialize` response — keep it in sync with the user-facing tool guidance.
- `src/installer/` — see below.
- `src/bin/codegraph.ts` — CLI (commander). Subcommands: `install`, `init`, `uninit`, `index`, `sync`, `status`, `query`, `files`, `context`, `affected`, `serve --mcp`.
- `src/ui/` — terminal UI (shimmer progress, worker).
- `src/ui-server/` -- read-only JSON API for the `codegraph ui` browser viewer (`api/`: `node`, `flow`, `map`, `screens`, `steps`, `deadcode`, `trails`, `program`, ...) plus static server; Svelte viewer lives in `ui/` (see `docs/design/codegraph-ui-design-spec.md`). `screens`/`steps`/`program` share one fold (`via`/`when` via `graph/branch-guards.ts`); `api/effects.ts` curates calls that leave the index; `api/route-roots.ts` names where a route's code starts. Derivations rendered by more than one surface belong in `src/graph/`, not `ToolHandler`.
  **Not released yet:** `codegraph ui` / `web` are refused (and hidden from `--help`) unless `CODEGRAPH_UI=1` is set — `src/bin/viewer-gate.ts`. Viewer changelog entries wait in `docs/viewer-launch-changelog.md`, not under `[Unreleased]`. At launch: delete the gate, move those entries back, drop the "not released yet" notes from `site/`.

### NodeKind / EdgeKind

Defined in `src/types.ts`. Both extractors and resolvers must use these exact strings.

- **NodeKind**: `file`, `module`, `class`, `struct`, `interface`, `trait`, `protocol`, `function`, `method`, `property`, `field`, `variable`, `constant`, `enum`, `enum_member`, `type_alias`, `namespace`, `parameter`, `import`, `export`, `route`, `component`, `union`.
- **EdgeKind**: `contains`, `calls`, `imports`, `exports`, `extends`, `implements`, `references`, `type_of`, `returns`, `instantiates`, `overrides`, `decorates`.

### Multi-agent installer

`src/installer/` is the entry point for `codegraph install` (and the bare `codegraph`/`npx @colbymchenry/codegraph` invocation). Architecture:

- `targets/registry.ts` lists every supported agent.
- `targets/types.ts` defines the `AgentTarget` interface — adding a 5th agent (Continue, Zed, Windsurf…) is **one new file in `targets/` + one entry in `registry.ts`**. Each target owns its config-file location and MCP-server JSON/TOML/JSONC writing. (Targets no longer write an instructions file — see below.)
- Current targets: `claude.ts`, `cursor.ts`, `codex.ts`, `opencode.ts`.
- `targets/toml.ts` is a hand-rolled TOML serializer scoped to `[mcp_servers.codegraph]` (used by Codex). Sibling tables and `[[array_of_tables]]` are preserved verbatim. No new dependency.
- opencode reads `opencode.jsonc` by default; the installer prefers existing `.jsonc`, falls back to `.json`, and creates `.jsonc` for greenfield installs. Edits are surgical via `jsonc-parser` so user comments and formatting survive install/re-install/uninstall round-trips. The MCP entry is OpenCode 2's native `mcp.servers.codegraph` with `disabled: false` and `codemode: false` (so `codegraph_explore` stays on the native tool list); a pre-#1698 `mcp.codegraph` + `enabled` entry is migrated on re-install and removed by uninstall.
- `instructions-template.ts` no longer holds an instructions body — it exports only the `<!-- CODEGRAPH_START -->`/`<!-- CODEGRAPH_END -->` markers. The installer **stopped writing** a `## CodeGraph` block into each agent's instructions file (`CLAUDE.md` / `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` / `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` / `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` / `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc` / Kiro steering doc) because it duplicated the MCP `initialize` instructions verbatim (issue #529). Each target's `install` (self-heal on upgrade) and `uninstall` use the markers to **strip** a block a previous install left behind. `server-instructions.ts` is the single source of truth for agent-facing guidance.
- All installer changes need matching coverage in `__tests__/installer-targets.test.ts` — there are ~47 parameterized contract tests covering install idempotency, sibling preservation, uninstall reverses install, byte-equal re-runs returning `unchanged`, and partial-state recovery for Codex.

### Cursor MCP working-directory quirk

Cursor launches MCP subprocesses with the wrong cwd and doesn't pass `rootUri` in `initialize`. The installer injects `--path` into Cursor's MCP args — absolute path for local installs, `${workspaceFolder}` for global installs. If you touch Cursor wiring, preserve this.

### MCP server instructions

`src/mcp/server-instructions.ts` is sent back to the agent in the MCP `initialize` response. This is the *first* thing every agent sees about how to use the tools, and as of issue #529 it is the **single source of truth** for agent-facing tool guidance — the installer no longer writes a duplicate `## CodeGraph` instructions block into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`. Edit tool guidance here and nowhere else.

## Retrieval performance & dynamic-dispatch coverage (do not regress)

CodeGraph's core value is letting an agent answer **structural/flow** questions ("how does X reach Y", trace, impact, callers) with a few **fast** codegraph calls and **zero Read/Grep**. The optimization target is **wall-clock latency + tool-call count** — *don't optimize for token cost*. (Cost is **lower**, not "flat" as earlier framing claimed: a current-build with-vs-without A/B across the 7 README repos, median of 4, saved on average **35% cost · 57% tokens · 46% time · 71% tool calls** — reproducing the published README. The mechanism is **far fewer turns over a much smaller accumulated context** — NOT cache-ability: the without-arm's huge token volume is *mostly* cheap cache-reads, which is why token-count savings (57%) look bigger than cost savings (35%). Measure tokens by **summing per-turn assistant usage**, not `result.usage` (last-turn only in current Claude Code). See `docs/benchmarks/call-sequence-analysis.md`.) The mechanism that drives everything here: **an agent falls back to Read/Grep the instant a codegraph answer is insufficient.** So every change is judged by one question — is codegraph's answer sufficient enough to *stop* the agent from reading?

**Target behavior:** a flow question resolves in **1 codegraph call on small repos, scaling to 3–5 on large**, with **Read/Grep = 0**. When reviewing a PR or trying something new, do not regress this.

### Adapt the tool to the agent — don't try to change the agent

The lever that decides whether a retrieval change lands. **Test before building anything here: does this make a tool the agent _already calls_ do more with the input it _already gives_? If it instead needs the agent to behave differently — pick a different tool, query differently, learn from examples — it hits the low-salience wall and won't land.**

CodeGraph's only channels to influence the agent are low-salience: the MCP `initialize` instructions (`server-instructions.ts`) and the tool descriptions. Changing them does **not** reliably move the agent's tool _choice_ or query style — validated: trace-first steering ported into the server-instructions + tool descriptions (3 wording variants) never reproduced what a CLI `--append-system-prompt` achieved, and **regressed** wall-clock vs baseline. New tools fare worse (rarely chosen — the agent under-picks even `trace`); "better examples" is the same steering. The agent's tool-choice does improve on its own as host models get better at tool use — but that is not ours to force.

What works is meeting the agent where it already is:
- **explore-flow** — `codegraph_explore` is the PRIMARY tool the agent reliably calls; its query is a precise bag of symbol names (incl. qualified `Class.method`) spanning the flow the agent is after; explore finds the call path _among those named symbols_ (riding synthesized edges) and leads its output with it. (`buildFlowFromNamedSymbols`: segment/co-naming disambiguation; ≤1 unnamed bridge so it never wanders a god-function's fan-out. Overload-aware: a PascalCase type token in the query biases an overloaded name to that type's own def — `DataRequest task` → DataRequest's `task`, not the abstract base; named-symbol files sort first.)
- **Sufficiency** — make the tool's output complete enough that the agent stops. `codegraph_node` returns the full body + the caller/callee trail, and for an AMBIGUOUS name returns **every overload's body in one call** (so the agent never Reads a file to find the right overload — validated on Alamofire/gin). This is the after-explore depth tool (labeled SECONDARY).
- **Errors teach abandonment** — one or two `isError: true` responses early in a session and the agent stops calling codegraph entirely (maintainer-observed, repeatedly). `isError` is reserved for genuine "stop trying" cases: security refusals (`PathRefusalError`) and real malfunctions (which carry a retry-once note). Every expected/recoverable condition — project not indexed, symbol not found, file not in the index — returns a **SUCCESS-shaped response carrying the guidance** (`NotIndexedError` → `textResult`, see `ToolHandler.execute`'s catch). The same principle is why the tool surface is **always exposed, even at an un-indexed root** (the old empty-`tools/list` gate was removed in #964 — it broke monorepos where only sub-projects carry a `.codegraph/`, and hid the tools from a session that started before `codegraph init`): safety comes from the response SHAPE (success-shaped guidance, never `isError`), not from hiding tools. An un-indexed root's `initialize` sends a per-project variant (`SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS_NO_ROOT_INDEX` — "pass `projectPath` to a project that has a `.codegraph/`"), not an "inactive" note; indexing is still deliberately the user's call, never the agent's.

What fails is the inverse — folding a precise answer into a **fuzzy-input** tool: the now-removed `codegraph_context` took a description, not symbols, so it couldn't disambiguate a flow's endpoints and surfaced the _wrong feature_ (which is why it was cut). Precise output needs precise input — explore takes a symbol bag for exactly this reason. (`codegraph_trace` was likewise removed: explore-flow does its job and the agent under-picked it.)

The remaining lever under this axis is **coverage**: every flow made to connect statically (a new dynamic-dispatch synthesizer, or extracting symbols static parsing skipped — e.g. object-literal store actions in `create((set,get)=>({...}))`) is then surfaced automatically by explore-flow, no agent change needed. Reactive/reconciler runtimes (Halo's `ReactiveExtensionClient`, MediatR, Vue Proxy) are the frontier — flows there have no static edges, so nothing surfaces (correctly — silent beats wrong). Full investigation + A/B record: `docs/benchmarks/call-sequence-analysis.md` + auto-memory `project_codegraph_read_displacement`.

### Explore budget — keep BOTH budgets monotonic with repo size

Two functions in `src/mcp/tools.ts` scale explore with indexed file count. This is the expected resolution (a regression here silently forces agents back to Read):

| Repo | files | explore calls | chars/call | per-file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| express (small) | 147 | 1 | 18K | 3800 |
| excalidraw/django (medium) | 643–3043 | 2 | 28K | 6500 |
| vscode (large) | 10446 | 3 | 35K | 7000 |
| ~20k / ~40k | — | 4 / 5 | 38K | 7000 |

- `getExploreBudget(fileCount)` → **call** budget: `<500→1, <5000→2, <15000→3, <25000→4, ≥25000→5` (max 5).
- `getExploreOutputBudget(fileCount)` → **per-call** output (chars / files / per-file). **Invariant: a larger tier must never get a smaller `maxCharsPerFile` than a smaller tier.** (Regression that motivated this doc: the `<5000` tier's 2500 was *below* the `<500` tier's 3800, so on a god-file repo — excalidraw's 415 KB `App.tsx` — one explore returned <1% of the file and forced a Read.)
- Explore output must **never tell the agent to "use Read"** — steer to another `codegraph_explore` and "treat returned source as already Read."

### Dynamic-dispatch coverage — the flow must EXIST in the graph end-to-end

Static tree-sitter extraction misses computed/indirect calls, so flows break at dynamic dispatch and the agent reads to reconstruct them. Synthesizers/resolvers bridge these so `codegraph_explore` connects them end-to-end (`src/resolution/callback-synthesizer.ts`, `src/resolution/frameworks/`). Channels today: callback/observer, EventEmitter, **React re-render** (`setState`→`render`), **JSX child** (`render`→child component), **React Native native→JS events** (`sendEvent(withName:)` / JVM `emit` → the `addListener` handler, named or inline, `rn-event-channel`), django ORM descriptor. The JS→native direction is a *resolver* (`frameworks/react-native.ts`: `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD`, `RCT_EXTERN_MODULE` Swift shims, TurboModules), which trusts receiver evidence — an alias bound to `NativeModules.X` — over the import resolver. All synthesized edges are `provenance:'heuristic'` with `metadata.synthesizedBy` + `registeredAt` (the wiring site), surfaced inline in `codegraph_explore`'s Flow section and the `codegraph_node` trail.

**Principle: partial coverage is WORSE than none.** Bridging one boundary but not the next reveals a hop the agent then drills + reads to finish. Measured on excalidraw: react-render alone *raised* reads to 5–7; only completing the flow (adding the jsx-child hop) dropped it to 0–1. **Always close the flow end-to-end and re-measure** — never ship a half-bridged flow.


### Validation methodology & worked examples

**Required** for every new language/framework: validate on small/medium/large real repos with >=3 flow prompts; deterministic probes (`scripts/agent-eval/probe-*.mjs`) then agent A/B (`scripts/agent-eval/run-all.sh` / `ab-new-vs-baseline.sh`). Pass bar: ~0 Read/Grep within the explore-call budget, faster than without-codegraph, no control-repo regression.

Full methodology (feedback metrics, CLI contamination guard, Sonnet/`--effort high` model policy, daemon pre-warm), the Excalidraw worked example, and coverage matrix live in:
- `docs/AGENTS.md` (nested; also loaded when cwd is under `docs/`)
- `docs/design/dynamic-dispatch-coverage-playbook.md`
- `docs/design/callback-edge-synthesis.md`
- `docs/benchmarks/call-sequence-analysis.md` / `docs/benchmarks/agent-eval-feedback-metrics.md`


Tests live in `__tests__/` and mirror the module they cover. Notable ones beyond the obvious:

- `installer-targets.test.ts` — parameterized contract suite across all 4 agent targets (see installer notes above).
- `evaluation/` — `runner.ts` + `test-cases.ts` exercise codegraph against synthetic projects and score the results; run via `npm run eval` (builds first). Not part of `npm test`.
- `sqlite-backend.test.ts` / `node-sqlite-backend.test.ts` — pin that `node:sqlite` is the sole backend: `getBackend()` reports `node-sqlite` and the DB comes up in WAL.
- `pr19-improvements.test.ts`, `frameworks-integration.test.ts` — regression coverage for specific past PRs/incidents; don't rename these, the names anchor to git history.

Tests create temp dirs with `fs.mkdtempSync` and clean up in `afterEach`. They write real files and exercise real SQLite — there is no DB mocking.

Every engine test file runs in a throwaway home dir (`__tests__/setup-home-sandbox.ts`, a `setupFiles` entry): `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` (+ Windows vars), `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` point into it, and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`CODEX_HOME`/… are cleared; spawned children inherit it. It's a backstop — still inject writes to global state (e.g. `UpgradeDeps.wirePromptHook`, #2275).

### Windows-gated tests

Behavior that differs by platform (path resolution, drive letters, `SENSITIVE_PATHS`, `%APPDATA%` config dirs, CRLF) must be gated, not assumed. Use `it.runIf(process.platform === 'win32')(...)` for Windows-only assertions and `it.runIf(process.platform !== 'win32')(...)` for POSIX-only ones — e.g. `/etc` is sensitive on POSIX but resolves to `C:\etc` (non-existent) on Windows, so an ungated `/etc` assertion fails on Windows. Validate the Windows side for real (see below); don't merge a Windows-gated test you haven't seen run.

## Cross-platform validation

The dev machine — and the default `npm test` target — is **macOS**, so local runs cover the macOS path. The other two platforms aren't here; when a change is platform-sensitive (file watching, sockets / named pipes, path & symlink handling, process lifecycle, inotify budget) validate them for real rather than guessing.

### Linux (Docker)

When asked to test or validate on Linux, use **Docker** — there's no Linux box, but Docker runs on the macOS host. Build a throwaway image from the repo and run the suite inside it:

- `FROM node:22-bookworm`; `COPY` the repo with a `.dockerignore` excluding `node_modules`/`dist`/`.git`/`.codegraph`; `RUN npm ci && npm run build`. Don't reuse the Mac `node_modules` — `esbuild`/`rollup` ship platform-specific binaries.
- Run with **`docker run --rm --init`**. The `--init` is load-bearing for any process-lifecycle test (daemon reaping, the #277 PPID watchdog, idle-timeout): without a zombie-reaping PID 1, a SIGKILL'd/exited process lingers as a zombie and `process.kill(pid, 0)` still reports it *alive*, so exit-detection assertions false-fail even though the process did exit.
- Linux is where the inotify watch budget actually bites: count a process's watches via `/proc/<pid>/fdinfo/*` (sum `^inotify ` lines on the fd whose `readlink` is `anon_inode:inotify`).

### Windows (Parallels VM + SSH)

For any Windows-specific PR, bug, or implementation, validate it on the real Windows VM rather than guessing. Connection details live in the gitignored **`.parallels`** file at the repo root (VM name, guest IP, SSH user/key). `prlctl exec` needs Parallels Pro and is unavailable, so SSH is the bridge.

- Connect / run from the Mac host: `ssh <user>@<guest_ip> "..."`. For multi-line work, pipe PowerShell over stdin and **refresh PATH from the registry** first (sshd's session has a stale PATH after winget installs):
  ```
  ssh colby@10.211.55.3 "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command -" <<'PS'
  $env:Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
  Set-Location C:\dev\codegraph
  PS
  ```
- Clone fresh into a **Windows-local** path (`C:\dev\codegraph`) and `npm ci` there — never run npm against the shared Mac repo, since `esbuild`/`rollup` ship platform-specific binaries.
- Guest toolchain (winget): Node LTS, Git, and the **VC++ ARM64 redistributable** (required by `@rollup/rollup-win32-arm64-msvc`, which vitest pulls in).
- Fetch a contributor PR head straight from their fork to dodge `pull/<n>/head` lag: `git fetch <fork-url> <branch>` then `git checkout -f FETCH_HEAD`.
- Windows baseline: as of #2053 the full suite passes on the Windows 11 (ARM64) VM. The only expected exception is `security.test.ts > Session marker symlink resistance > does not follow a pre-planted symlink`, which needs symlink privileges (Developer Mode) — confirm any other failure against `origin/main` before blaming your PR. The former `mcp-initialize.test.ts` / `mcp-roots.test.ts` `EPERM` teardown failures came from tests spawning `serve --mcp` without the runtime flags (its `--liftoff-only` re-exec grandchild kept the cwd / SQLite file open); spawn it with `WASM_RUNTIME_FLAGS` and await the child's exit before removing the temp dir. Windows checkouts may be CRLF — split source lines on `/\r?\n/` in tests.
- Windows worker crashes: a worker thread that ends (`terminate()`, its own `process.exit()`, or the process exiting) while V8's concurrent marker is marking its heap kills the process with exit 3221225477 (0xC0000005) and leaves no error or dump. It's worst while the worker is still loading its modules. Owners must not terminate a worker before its first message (`workerStarted` / `terminateOnceStarted`, or the pool's own handshake), and a worker that exits itself calls `collectBeforeExit()` first — both in `src/worker-teardown.ts`. `--no-concurrent-marking` also stops it, but measured about a third slower indexing on the Windows VM, so it is not used.

## Releases

Released to npm and mirrored as [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/releases). `CHANGELOG.md` is the source of truth; GitHub Release notes are extracted from it.

### Writing changelog entries

**Default: write entries under `## [Unreleased]`** — that's the section reserved for work landing between releases. **Don't pre-create a `## [X.Y.Z]` block** for the next release: the Release workflow's first step is `scripts/prepare-release.mjs`, which automatically promotes everything under `[Unreleased]` into a new `## [X.Y.Z] - <YYYY-MM-DD>` block at release time (or merges into a pre-existing `[X.Y.Z]` block if one exists — but you don't need one). Pre-staging is what caused the v0.9.5 sparse-release-notes incident: a sparse `[0.9.5]` block hand-added before the rest of the work landed got picked by the extractor over the much-larger `[Unreleased]` section above it. Don't do that.

Formatting rules for any entry (anywhere — `[Unreleased]` or otherwise):

1. **Write friendly, user-facing notes — not engineer-facing ones.** Group under `### New Features` and `### Fixes` (sentence-case). Surface `### Breaking Changes` and `### Security` as their own sections **only when the release has them**; fold improvement-flavored changes into New Features. Omit empty sections. (This replaces the old Keep-a-Changelog `Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Deprecated` grouping: the GitHub Release page extracts each version block **verbatim** via `scripts/extract-release-notes.mjs`, and the old dense, implementation-focused entries rendered as an unreadable wall of text — so the whole CHANGELOG was rewritten to this format and every published release re-noted to match.)
2. **One plain-language sentence per bullet:** what changed and why it matters to a user. Lead with the capability, or with the symptom that's now fixed.
3. **Strip the internals.** No internal file paths (`src/...`), no internal symbol / function / class names, no benchmark numbers / percentages / node-or-edge counts. **Keep:** language & framework names (Go, Spring, NestJS, …), things a user types or sets (`codegraph install`, `codegraph_explore`, the `CODEGRAPH_*` env vars), agent / IDE names (Claude Code, Cursor, opencode, Kiro, …), and a brief `Thanks @user` when a contributor is credited.
4. Issue / PR references in entries are by number (`(#403)` etc.); the GitHub renderer auto-links them in the published release notes.
5. **Don't add a `[X.Y.Z]: https://...` link reference yourself** — `prepare-release.mjs` appends it automatically when it promotes the version (idempotent: a re-run is a no-op if it already exists).
6. **Every release opens with a `### Highlights` block — the only part most people read.** At most ~8 one-line bullets, in plain language for someone who doesn't read code, ordered by what a typical user notices first (new agent/IDE support and setup changes, then answer quality, then reliability), plus a one-sentence upgrade note when a re-index is needed. Write or refresh it in `[Unreleased]` when a release is being prepared — not per PR — and keep the detailed `### New Features` / `### Fixes` entries below it. When `### Fixes` grows past ~15 entries, group them under `####` sub-headings (`Better answers from codegraph_explore`, `Finding your project, live updates, and the CLI`, `Indexing reliability and disk usage`, `Language and framework accuracy`) so a skimmer can find their area.

Multi-word headings like `### New Features` are safe on the normal release path: `prepare-release.mjs` **Case A** moves the whole `[Unreleased]` body verbatim into `[X.Y.Z]`. (Only its rarely-used **Case B** *merge* splits sub-sections with a single-word `^### (\w+)$` regex that wouldn't match them — and Case B fires only if a `[X.Y.Z]` block was pre-created, which rule above already forbids.)

### Release flow (the user runs these)

Releases are built and published by the **GitHub Actions "Release" workflow**
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`). It runs `scripts/prepare-release.mjs` to
promote `[Unreleased]` into `[<version>]` (and auto-commit + push that
CHANGELOG change back to `main` so on-disk truth matches the published
notes), then bundles a Node runtime per platform (`scripts/build-bundle.sh`)
and publishes both the GitHub Release and the npm thin-installer
(`scripts/pack-npm.sh`: a shim package + per-platform packages).
Publishing manually is **wrong** now — a plain `npm publish` ships the root
package (non-bundled), which breaks anyone on Node < 22.5.

**Claude does NOT bump the version unless explicitly asked.** The maintainer
typically does it themselves — often by editing `package.json` directly via
the GitHub web UI. Don't proactively commit a version bump as part of
unrelated work, and don't propose one when summarizing a PR.

When the maintainer DOES bump the version, the only edit strictly required is
to `package.json` — the workflow's "Sync package-lock.json" step detects a
mismatch between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, runs
`npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` to rewrite the lock file's
version fields (top-level + `packages.""`), and auto-commits + pushes the
result back to `main` with `[skip ci]`. So a GitHub-web-UI single-file edit to
`package.json` is enough to kick off a clean release. (If they edit both files
locally, that's fine too — the sync step no-ops.) Bump `ui/package.json` to the
same version in that change: the component library is versioned with the
engine, `ui-package.test.ts` pins it, and the workflow does not sync it — the
1.6.1 bump left `main` red on exactly that.

Once `package.json` is at the target version on `main`, trigger
**Actions → Release → Run workflow** (on `main`). The workflow:

1. Syncs `package-lock.json` to `package.json`'s version if they've drifted; commits + pushes that change.
2. Runs `prepare-release.mjs <X.Y.Z>` → promotes `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] - <today>` in `CHANGELOG.md`, appends the link reference, commits + pushes the move with `[skip ci]`.
3. Builds every platform bundle on one runner, generates `SHA256SUMS`.
4. Creates the GitHub Release with notes from the freshly-promoted `[X.Y.Z]` block.
5. Publishes the npm shim + per-platform packages. Requires the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret.

**Do not run `npm publish`, `git push`, or `git tag` yourself** — these are
publish actions on shared state. Write the files, hand the user the commands.

## House rules

- The `0.7.x` line is in active multi-agent rollout. Any change to `src/installer/` (especially `targets/`) needs corresponding test coverage and a CHANGELOG entry — installer regressions break every new install silently.
- When changing what the MCP tools do or how agents should use them, edit `src/mcp/server-instructions.ts` — it is the **single source of truth** for agent-facing tool guidance (issue #529). The installer no longer writes a duplicate instructions block into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` / `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc` / Kiro steering, so there's nothing to keep in sync anymore. (The repo's own checked-in `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc` is dogfooding config — update it too if you use Cursor on this repo, but it ships nowhere.)
- **Before adding or extending a router, a web framework, or a language's `WHEN` rules, read `docs/design/framework-coverage.md`.** It is the standing answer to "what is supported and what is left" across the three axes (route nodes → Entry points, `navigates` edges → Screens, branch-guard rules → the `WHEN` labels), with what each remaining item needs, the traps that have already cost debugging time, and the queries to re-verify it. Update it in the same change that moves a row.
- CodeGraph provides **code context**, not product requirements. For new features, ask the user about UX, edge cases, and acceptance criteria — the graph won't tell you.
- **When the user references issues, PR comments, or external reports, anchor them to a date and version before drawing conclusions.** Check the comment's `createdAt` against:
  - The **last released version** — `grep -m1 '^## \[' CHANGELOG.md` shows the top-of-file version (older releases follow). A comment dated before the latest `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` is reacting to *released* state — work that's only on `main` or on an unmerged branch doesn't apply.
  - The **last main commit** — `git log --first-parent main -1 --format='%ai %h %s'`. A comment after the last release but before a fix on main may already be addressed there but unreleased.
  - The **current branch's tip** — your own unmerged work obviously can't be what the comment is reacting to.
  Always disambiguate "released," "merged-but-unreleased," and "in-progress" before agreeing that a user-reported problem is unfixed (or that a fix is incomplete). A user saying "your fix only covers X" about a recent PR is usually pointing at the *released* shortcomings — your in-flight branch may already address them but they have no way to know that.
- **Version-tag every image referenced in `README.md`.** GitHub caches README images (`raw.githubusercontent.com` with a 5-minute TTL; third-party hosts sit behind the long-lived camo proxy), so updating an asset in place can keep showing the stale version. Give each README image URL a `?v=N` query tag and **bump `N` in the same commit whenever the asset bytes change** — e.g. `assets/waitlist.svg?v=2`. The changed URL sidesteps every cache so the new image shows immediately instead of waiting on a TTL to expire.
