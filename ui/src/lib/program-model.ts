/**
 * The Steps picture in the code's ORDER — the same canvas, laid out by when
 * things happen rather than by how far they are from the anchor.
 *
 * The tree's rows are distance: on proshop's login `User.findOne`, `jwt.sign`,
 * `200` and `401` are each one step out of the handler, so they land in one
 * row. True, and not the flow — the token is signed while the reply is being
 * built, so the `200` comes AFTER it, and the `401` is the other side of the
 * same `if`. This model draws that:
 *
 * ```
 *                POST /api/users/login
 *                        |
 *                  User.findOne
 *          +-------------+--------------+
 *   WHEN user AND (await ...)     WHEN NOT (...)
 *          |                            |
 *      jwt.sign                        401
 *          |
 *         200
 * ```
 *
 * **A line here means "then", not "calls"** — that is the whole difference from
 * the other reading, and the key says so. It comes from the block tree the
 * server folds out of the walk (`api/program.ts`): items in source order, forks
 * where the code forks, an arm that answers or leaves ending there. Walking that
 * tree with a set of *tails* — the steps a next step would follow — gives one
 * edge per "and then", carrying the arm's condition where the code branched.
 *
 * Everything else is the canvas's: the same boxes, the same layout engine, the
 * same pills, hover and panel. Only the graph changes.
