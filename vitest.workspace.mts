/**
 * Two projects, one command (`npm test` still runs everything).
 *
 * The split exists because of exactly one suite. `ui-package.test.ts` mounts
 * `@colbymchenry/codegraph-ui`'s components against a mock adapter (task
 * CG-61), and to do that it needs three things the engine's suites must never
 * see:
 *
 *   - the **Svelte plugin**, to compile `.svelte` and `.svelte.ts` modules;
 *   - **jsdom**, because a component without a document is not a render;
 *   - `resolve.conditions: ['browser']`, so `svelte` resolves to its client
 *     build rather than its server one (`mount()` throws on the server).
 *
 * That last one is why this is a workspace rather than one config with a
 * couple of extra fields. `browser` is a package-resolution condition, not a
 * test setting: applied globally it would also hand the engine's suites the
 * browser builds of `web-tree-sitter` and friends, and the failures that
 * causes look nothing like their cause.
 *
 * The engine project `extends` the shared base, so the env vars, Node guard and
 * home-dir sandbox in `vitest.config.mts` still apply to every engine test. The
 * ui project does not — see the note on it.
