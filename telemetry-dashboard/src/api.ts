/**
 * The dashboard's read API: one JSON endpoint per chart shape, all of them
 * scoped by the same `?from=&to=` range the picker drives.
 *
 * Rules this file keeps:
 * - **Rollups only.** Every panel is answered from `daily_*`, `machine_days` and
 *   `machine_first_seen`, which are kept forever. No panel reads raw `events`:
 *   D1 runs one query at a time per database, so one slow scan there fails every
 *   panel queued behind it. (/api/meta reads the table's first and last day, one
 *   indexed lookup each.)
 * - **Today is in range; uncounted days are not zeros.** Rolled-up numbers stop
 *   at the nightly rollup's last day and come back null after it, so a chart
 *   ending today draws a gap where the count has not happened yet, not a cliff.
 * - **Parameterized, always.** No value from the query string is ever
 *   concatenated into SQL. Dimensions and metrics are looked up in the tables
 *   below and rejected with a 400 if they are not there, so even the column
 *   *names* a caller can reach are a closed set.
 * - **Chart-shaped.** Responses come back as `labels[] + datasets[]` so the
 *   frontend does no arithmetic; every response also carries `rows` in its
 *   natural shape, which is what the per-panel table view renders.
 * - **No Response objects.** Handlers return plain data and let src/index.ts
 *   apply the security headers, so there is exactly one place where headers on
 *   an authenticated response are decided.

 * The cohort key is `machine_first_seen`, not install events: a machine that
 * reinstalls does not re-enter the funnel, which is what makes this a
 * conversion rate rather than an install-event ratio.
 *
 * "Ran an index" is `machine_first_seen.first_index_day`, which the nightly rollup
 * keeps at the earliest day each machine indexed. That makes this a range read over
 * one small table. It used to be a join against raw `events` — on production volume
 * ~55 s per week of cohorts, which held D1's single query lane long enough to fail
 * every other panel waiting behind it. A first index day is never before the first
 * day (the ingest path keeps first_day at the machine's earliest event), so "within
 * the window" is just `first_index_day <= first_day + window`.
 *
 * Because first_index_day is rolled up, cohorts after the rollup's last day have no
 * conversions counted yet. They are left out of the totals and drawn as gaps —
 * counting them would show a drop in conversion that is only a lag.
