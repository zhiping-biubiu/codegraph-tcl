/**
 * How a single-file component's script joins the component — shared by the
 * Vue, Svelte and Astro extractors, which hand each `<script>` block (or
 * Astro's frontmatter) to the TypeScript extractor and fold its result back.
 *
 * The fold used to keep the block's own file node and make the component
 * contain it AND every node in the block, so the hierarchy ran file-inside-
 * component and every member had two parents: the Symbol view listed a
 * component's script twice, with the component and its file among its own
 * members. And everything the block did at its top level stayed on that file
 * node — but `<script setup>`, a Svelte instance script and Astro's
 * frontmatter run once per component instance, so their top-level calls ARE
 * the component's doing: a Nuxt page's `useAsyncData(…)`, a Svelte page's
 * `onMount(…)`. With them on the file, a walk from the component found
 * nothing, and the viewer's Steps tab drew a screen alone.
 *
 * Now: the SFC has one file node, the whole file, holding the component; what
 * the block holds at its top level the component holds, and a nested symbol
 * keeps its own parent; a per-instance block's top-level calls and references
 * — a top-level constant's initializer's included — are the component's,
 * while its imports, and everything a module-level block does, stay with the
 * file.
