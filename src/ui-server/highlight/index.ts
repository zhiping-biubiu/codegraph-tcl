/**
 * Server-side syntax classification for the viewer's code block.
 *
 * The classes come off the engine's OWN tree-sitter parse (CG-57). Until then
 * the viewer ran a second highlighter — Shiki, plus 56 pruned TextMate grammars
 * shipped beside the binary — over source the engine had already parsed with a
 * real grammar. That is gone: one grammar set, one opinion about what a `.ts`
 * file is, nothing extra in the bundle, and roughly an order of magnitude off
 * the cost on the language that used to be worst (see below).
 *
 * Three properties are unchanged, because they are what make this safe to
 * depend on:
 *
 * * **It never fails a request.** A grammar that will not load, a parse that
 *   throws, a language nobody wrote a grammar for, a slice too big to be worth
 *   parsing — every one of them answers `engine: 'plain'` with a reason and the
 *   source still goes out. Highlighting is the part that degrades; nothing else
 *   does.
 * * **Identifiers survive whatever token boundaries the grammar chose.** Every
 *   code token is split into identifier runs before it goes on the wire, which
 *   is what lets the viewer wrap a call site as a link by *claiming a token*
 *   rather than re-tokenising the line on top of the classifier's answer.
 * * **The classification is a class name, not a colour.** The viewer paints
 *   from CSS custom properties, so one token stream serves light and dark and
 *   the design tokens live in exactly one place.
 *
 * ## Cost, measured
 *
 * On the dev Mac, 3 000 lines, cold (parse + classify + wire):
 *
 * | | TypeScript | Go | Python |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | Shiki (was) | ~700 ms | 43–57 ms | 35–47 ms |
 * | tree-sitter (now) | 24–41 ms | ~30 ms | 25–29 ms |
 *
 * Rust, Ruby, PHP, C# and Swift all land between 14 and 27 ms on the same
 * measurement. TypeScript's TextMate grammar was 5–7× every other one and the
 * cost was regex *execution*, not compilation — nothing about the old module
 * could have fixed it, and it is now the same order as everything else. The
 * slice cache still exists, because a re-render (a theme flip, a resize,
 * stepping back through the trail) should cost nothing at all, and because a
 * whole-file view pages the same file repeatedly.
