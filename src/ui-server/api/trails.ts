/**
 * `GET/POST/DELETE /api/trails` — saved trails, the reader's own tours through
 * the graph (design spec §3.12).
 *
 * A trail is the path of symbols someone walked to explain something: "how a
 * request is served", "everything the token expiry touches". The viewer already
 * carries one in the URL; this is the same walk given a name and kept, so the
 * next person — or the same person next week — starts at the explanation rather
 * than at the search box.
 *
 * ## The one thing this feature has to get right
 *
 * **A trail must survive a re-index.** A node's id contains its start line, so
 * inserting an import at the top of a file renames every symbol below it. A
 * trail keyed on ids would break the first time anybody edited the code it
 * describes — which is exactly when it matters. So a hop is stored as what it
 * *is* — qualified name, kind, file — with the id kept only as a fast path, and
 * every hop is re-resolved against the current index on the way out:
 *
 * - the recorded id still names the same symbol → `ok`
 * - the qualified name resolves somewhere else → `moved`, and the row says
 *   where from
 * - the name is now carried by several symbols and none is in the recorded
 *   file → `ambiguous`, best guess offered and labelled as one
 * - nothing answers to it → `missing`, and the row says "moved or renamed"
 *
 * Nothing is silently dropped and nothing is silently guessed: a trail that has
 * decayed says so on its own row, which is the point at which its author can
 * fix it.
 *
 * ## What it opens
 *
 * A trail with a hole in it cannot be handed to the viewer whole — the `t`
 * param is a PATH, and stitching hop 2 to hop 4 would draw an adjacency that
 * does not exist. So the payload carries the longest run of consecutive
 * resolved hops, and the row says when that is less than the whole trail.
 *
 * Storage — the only write `codegraph ui` makes — is `./trail-store.ts`.
