/**
 * `GET /api/map` — the repository at module granularity.
 *
 * The Map answers "what is in here and how is it organised" without anybody
 * having drawn a diagram: modules are directories, the arrows between them are
 * the edges the index already holds, and the vertical order falls out of the
 * dependency direction (design spec §3.6). This module produces the *data*;
 * the layering, cycle-breaking and geometry are pure functions in the viewer
 * (`ui/src/lib/map-model.ts`), so toggling tests or selecting a module never
 * costs a round-trip.
 *
 * Three decisions shape the payload, and all three are about not lying:
 *
 * **A module is a directory, not a guess.** `moduleIdFor` maps each indexed
 * file to the first {@link MapQuery.depth} path segments under the chosen root.
 * A file sitting loose in the root gets folded into one `(root files)` box —
 * except a façade (`index.ts`, `lib.rs`, `__init__.py`), which is its own box
 * because it is the thing everything else imports. No clustering, no
 * heuristics about "what belongs together": if two files are in the same
 * directory the repository already said they belong together.
 *
 * **Weight counts edges; layering counts *declared* edges.** A link's `count`
 * is every confident cross-module edge behind it, which is what the reader
 * sees as thickness. Its `declared` count is the subset resolved through an
 * import, a qualified name, an inheritance clause or a typed receiver — and
 * that is what the layout layers on. The difference is not academic: on this
 * repository, bare name matching resolves calls to `run`, `push` and `finish`
 * across unrelated directories, and layering on raw counts puts the storage
 * layer directly under the CLI. Layering on declared edges reproduces the
 * pipeline the project's own docs describe.
 *
 * **Nothing is dropped silently.** Uncertain edges (confidence below
 * {@link UNCERTAIN_BELOW}) are excluded from every count, and how many were
 * excluded rides on the payload so the side panel can say so.
