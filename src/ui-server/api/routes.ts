/**
 * `GET /api/routes` — the URL to handler map, when the project has one.
 *
 * The engine's routing manifest is a flat list of (url, handler, file, line)
 * rows; it deliberately carries no node ids, because its own consumer (the MCP
 * context builder) renders text. A reader needs to *navigate*, so each entry is
 * matched back to its handler's node id here — batched by file, never a lookup
 * per route.
 *
 * `null` from the engine means "fewer than three real routes", i.e. this
 * project is not a routed app. That is reported as an empty manifest with
 * `routed: false` rather than as an error: "this isn't a web app" is an
 * answer, not a failure.
 *
 * Two things about the manifest shape the numbers here have to work around.
 * Its `limit` is applied in SQL *before* the three-route test, so asking for
 * fewer than three would make every routed project look unrouted — hence the
 * floor on the parameter. And its own `totalRoutes` counts only the rows inside
 * that window, so the headline count comes from the graph's `route` nodes
 * instead, which is the number a reader means by "how many routes are there".
