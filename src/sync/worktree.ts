/**
 * Git Worktree Awareness
 *
 * A CodeGraph index lives in a `.codegraph/` directory and is resolved by
 * walking up parent directories to the nearest one (see
 * `findNearestCodeGraphRoot`). That walk is unaware of git worktrees: when a
 * worktree is created *inside* the main checkout (e.g. some tools place them
 * under `.gitignore`d paths like `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`), a command run
 * from the worktree walks up and silently resolves the MAIN checkout's index.
 *
 * Every query then returns results from the main tree's code — usually a
 * different branch — rather than the worktree the user is actually editing.
 * Symbols added or changed only in the worktree are invisible. This module
 * detects that "borrowed index" situation so callers can warn about it.
 *
 * Detection is best-effort: when git is unavailable or the path isn't a repo,
 * it reports "no mismatch" and callers carry on unchanged.
