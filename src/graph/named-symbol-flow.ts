/**
 * The call path among a bag of named symbols — the one path finder.
 *
 * `codegraph_explore` leads its answer with a "Flow" section: the longest call
 * chain among the symbols an agent named, riding synthesized dynamic-dispatch
 * edges so a controller reaches its implementation through the interface. The
 * viewer's Flow strip (`/api/flow`, design spec §3.5) draws the same thing as
 * cards. They must never disagree, so the search lives here once and both
 * callers ride it: same token parsing, same overload disambiguation, same
 * bridge budget, same edges.
 *
 * What differs between the two callers is expressed as OPTIONS, not as a second
 * implementation:
 *
 * - **`mode: 'named'`** is exactly what explore does. Every resolved symbol is
 *   both a possible start and a possible end, at most ONE unnamed symbol may
 *   bridge two named ones ({@link DEFAULT_MAX_BRIDGE}), and the LONGEST chain
 *   wins. The bridge cap is what stops the search wandering a god-function's
 *   fan-out: the agent's own naming is the evidence that a hop is on-topic.
 * - **`mode: 'directed'`** is "how does X reach Y", which the agent has no way
 *   to ask and the viewer's search box does. Both ends are pinned, so the
 *   evidence the bridge cap was standing in for is already there and the search
 *   bridges freely — a two-token query under the named rules could never return
 *   more than three cards. The SHORTEST path wins, because with both ends fixed
 *   a longer route is a detour rather than a fuller answer.
 *
 * Overloads are handled differently for the same reason. A bare ambiguous name
 * in `named` mode is filtered by CO-NAMING (keep `list` only where the agent
 * also named its class); in `directed` mode every candidate for both endpoints
 * is tried and the pair that actually connects is the answer — which is a
 * better disambiguator than co-naming and the only one available when the
 * whole query is two words.
