// DEFINES the explore pipeline scored — which is how three

// explore allocate its output budget across files" response on nothing but a
// local `explore` and a `BUDGET` constant. Four levers — the first three are
// multiplicative, so they compose without ordering surprises; the fourth decides
// admission from the result:
//
//   1. KIND      — what a match on this NodeKind actually tells you (below).
//   2. ISOLATION — a weak-kind symbol nothing calls or references is a pure name
//                  collision; participation in the graph is the corroboration.
//   3. PENALTY   — generated / test / i18n files are weaker answers to an
//                  architecture question at EVERY signal, not just as the
//                  tiebreak-at-equal-score they used to be.
//   4. FLOOR     — admission scales with the best file's score, replacing an
//                  absolute bar that admitted noise wherever the top score was
//                  high.

   *
   * Robust to FTS sampling bias: the same-name family is a capped FTS sample that
