/**
 * Query pool — runs CPU-heavy read-tool calls on a pool of worker threads so
 * the shared daemon's main event loop stays free for the MCP transport.
 *
 * Why this exists: see {@link ./query-worker}. One daemon, one event loop, one
 * synchronous SQLite connection serializes every concurrent `codegraph_explore`
 * AND starves the transport (a 10-way wave delivered 0 transport heartbeats in
 * 25s — responses can't flush until the whole batch drains, so clients time
 * out). Spreading the dispatch across worker threads (each its own WAL read
 * connection) restores true multi-core parallelism and an idle main loop.
 *
 * Properties:
 *   - lazy growth: one warm worker on construct, grows to `size` on demand, so a
 *     single-agent session pays for one connection and a 10-subagent burst grows
 *     to the core budget.
 *   - crash recovery: a dead worker is respawned and its in-flight call retried
 *     once; a poison call that keeps crashing fails gracefully (never wedges the
 *     pool). A crash budget trips a circuit breaker (`healthy` → false) so the
 *     caller falls back to in-process dispatch instead of thrashing respawns.
 *   - graceful backstop: a call that can't be served within `softTimeoutMs`
 *     resolves with SUCCESS-shaped "busy, retry" guidance — never `isError`, so
 *     a momentary overload can't teach the agent to abandon codegraph — instead
 *     of hanging past the client's hard timeout.
