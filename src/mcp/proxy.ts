/**
 * MCP proxy mode — issue #411.
 *
 * The proxy is a near-transparent stdio↔socket pipe. Once it has verified
 * the daemon's hello line (same major.minor.patch as ours), it does no
 * protocol parsing of its own: every byte the MCP host writes to the proxy's
 * stdin goes straight to the daemon socket, and every byte the daemon emits
 * goes straight to the host's stdout. Server-initiated JSON-RPC requests
 * (e.g. `roots/list`) flow through the same pipe transparently.
 *
 * Lifecycle expectations:
 *   - The proxy exits when *either* stream closes (host stdin closed →
 *     daemon socket end, or daemon-side socket close → host stdout end).
 *   - Closing the socket on the proxy side is what tells the daemon to
 *     decrement its connected-clients refcount.
 *   - On a parent-process death we can't detect via stdin close (e.g. SIGKILL
 *     of the MCP host), the proxy's PPID watchdog catches it — same logic
 *     the direct-mode server uses; see issue #277.
