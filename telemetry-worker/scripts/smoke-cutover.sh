# The cutover gate (CG-14): drives the WHOLE chain the way production will run it —
# a client POSTs a batch, the ingest worker writes D1, the nightly rollup aggregates,
# and the dashboard reads the numbers back out.
#
# Every other suite tests one link. smoke-ingest.sh stops at the `events` table,
# smoke-rollup.sh hand-checks the rollup SQL, and smoke-api.sh reads a fixture that
# was written by hand rather than by the cron. That leaves exactly the seam this
# cutover turns on unverified: the dimension names the rollup WRITES versus the ones
# the dashboard READS. Those two lists live in different workers on different
# branches, and a mismatch is silent — no error, no failed request, just a panel that
# renders zero forever. Catching that after cutover means a day of lost telemetry;
# catching it here costs a minute.
#
# Both workers declare the same D1 `database_id`, so pointing them at one
# `--persist-to` directory gives them literally the same local SQLite file. The state
# is a fresh mktemp each run, so every expected number below is exact rather than a
# lower bound.
#
#   npm run smoke:cutover
#
# Expected numbers are derived from THE_BATCH below and nothing else; see the table
# in that comment block.
