# End-to-end check of the nightly rollup + retention purge against a real
# `wrangler dev` and the local D1 state.
#
# Seeds three synthetic days of events straight into local D1 (the ingest path clamps
# client timestamps to the last 30 days, so backdating far enough to exercise the purge
# has to bypass it), drives the rollup through the admin endpoint and the cron handler,
# then inspects what actually landed against hand-computed numbers.
#
# What it pins:
#   * rollup numbers match the events they came from, including the two that are easy
#     to get wrong — usage_rollup SUMs its `count` prop, and array props unnest
#   * running a day twice changes nothing (idempotent upserts, no double counting)
#   * ?reset=1 drops stale rollup rows on a live day and REFUSES to blank a day whose
#     raw events are already purged
#   * the purge deletes only rows past the window, and leaves machine_days /
#     machine_first_seen alone
#   * each machine's first_index_day is its earliest index, and survives the purge
#   * the cron catches up on a day that saw activity but was never rolled up
#   * usage comes from usage_daily; a legacy usage row still in `events` is folded
#     into it (counts added, row deleted) before the day is rolled up
#   * /admin/rollup does not exist without ADMIN_TOKEN, and rejects a wrong one
#
# Re-runnable: it wipes its own synthetic days first, and they are chosen to sit
# outside the cron's 3-day lookback so the nightly run never rewrites them.
